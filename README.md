Onboard memory manager for Logitech G devices. 

Based heavily on [tulth/g600prog](https://github.com/tulth/g600prog)

## Disclaimer

This has been tested by me to work for my device. No guarantee it will work, and no guarantee it won't brick your device.

Highly recommend you run a `--dry-run` before actually writing to the device.
